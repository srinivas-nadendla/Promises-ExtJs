Promise
---------------------------

The Promise is an object and it is used for asynchronous computations. A Promise represents an operation that hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.

Promise natively intoduced in the ECMAScript-6 but before that we have lot of implementations of it like Q, RSVP.js, WinJs, when.js.

States of Promise

Promise has three states

1. fullfilled : Action releted to promise succeeded
2. rejected : Action related to promise failed
3. pending : Has not fullfilled or rejected yet
