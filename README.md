# Promises In Extjs

Promise
---------------------------

The Promise is an object and it is used for asynchronous computations. A Promise represents an operation that hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.

Promise natively intoduced in the ECMAScript-6 but before that we have lot of implementations of it like Q, RSVP.js, WinJs, when.js.

States of Promise
--------------------------
A Promise is in one of these states:

1. fullfilled : meaning that the operation is succeeded.
2. rejected : meaning that the operation is failed.
3. pending : operation is not yet fullfilled or rejected
